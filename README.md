# Strava-Filter
Removes yoga activities from strava

# Changes in this repo compared to Felix
The goal is now to remove all activities that have zero distance traveled. This is due to the fact that the Garmin Forerunner 245 music reports all non running/walking activities as running. For example custom made workouts such as padel or squash and also yoga and so on.
